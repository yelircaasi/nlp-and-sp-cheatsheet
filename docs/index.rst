Speech and Language Processing Cheatsheet
=========================================

Brief overview of concepts in computational linguistics (and neighboring areas) with explanations, illustrations, code snippets, and useful links.

Note: This is intended to provide an accessible introdution to the subject matter, or a light refresher for those with previous exposure. There are already very good textbooks and papers providing full rigor and terseness of exposition; this resource attempts to appeal a bit more to intuition and explain concepts in simple prose where possible,  although mathematical notation is used where appropriate. This is a free, community-contributed resource, and while we do our best to keep it accurate and up-to-date, there may be errors. Use at your own risk.
