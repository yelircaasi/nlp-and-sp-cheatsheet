# nlp-and-sp-cheatsheet

Source for the [NLP and SP Cheatsheet](https://nlp-and-sp-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Still a work in progress, and I plan to work more in it toward the end of the year.

## Contributing

To build the docs, install `sphinx` and a theme, for example `sphonx_rtd_theme`. The recommended installation is via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Then, in the `docs` folder, run `make html`.

```shell
cd nlp-and-sp-cheatsheet
poetry install
cd docs
make html
```
